## Thoughts on Management
There is more to this than what follows, but my guiding stars are:
* People are the difference. Hire driven people who love to work in a high trust, high accountability environment. People need to know they
are trusted to do what's right, and if they fail then they should be celebrated for their initative. The right
people will be harder on themselves than you ever could be when they fail. You don't need to say anything to the *right* people.
* Fail forward: Learn from failures in a no-blame culture. If you are not failing, you are not pushing hard enough.
* Be a servant leader
* Hire smart people, give them clear direction, and get out of the way (I forgot where I heard this)

# Career
For a brief overview, please check out [my resume](/assets/resume.pdf).

I love software. It was an early passion for me. I am so lucky that I can
build a career around what I love.

The following expands the information available on my resume. I'm not sure
who will ever read this, but in case you are curious to learn more about me, please read on.

## Love of Computing
Coding has been my lifelong passion. I started writing code on a Commodore 64 and playing around on an Apple IIe in the mid-80s.
I started my computer science degree in 1995 and graduated in 2000.

During college, I took a 9-month internship with Extended Systems where I worked on a database server written in C. I had some fantastic mentors early in my career who helped me understand how to write elegant, scalable, performant code, that is well tested and well engineered. This carried forward through college and in to my professional career.

## Early Career
After graduation in 2000, the tech bubble burst, and I found work writing a system to integrate an older VMS/Unix system with Windows. It involved writing software servers in C/C++ and creating COM components for the Windows workstations and servers. The system was a success and is still in use to this day. It’s funny how old systems are so hard to kill.

After that project, I started really getting in to Design Patterns and enterprise architecture. There was an increasing demand for Windows applications and my employer did not have a good technical response to meet the market and customer demands. There were no OOMs on the market and we needed something to encapsulate data access and reduce the code duplication. I created a OOM written in C# (.NET) and based on then enterprise architecture ideas outlined in Martin Fowler’s awesome book, Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture. I also had to create an integration path that allowed the new system to evolve along side of the legacy system, which was to be phased out over a few years. Was it perfect? Of course not, but it did allow them to move forward and I learned more from that project than any other project in my career.

I was fortunate in that my employer viewed my work as a success and appreciated my desires to advance the company’s interests. By 2006, I felt I had tackled many technical challenges and wanted to try my hand at people management. I started managing the architecture group I was a part of. After a year, I realized how much I missed coding and was coincidentally approached by a consulting firm to assist them as an enterprise architect. I took the job.

The enterprise architect job had me traveling all over the United States, working crazy-long hours, but I was learning so much that I didn’t even notice. Each week was an opportunity to help a new company with a new technical challenge. It was great job but then the 2008 recession hit and the consulting company burned out. I had a list of clients and I managed to pull in money until I was approached by some colleges at RightNot Technologies.

## RightNow and Oracle
I was hired at RightNow as a people manager. It was a great opportunity and I was ready to try people management again. My time at RightNow introduced me to several Fortune 500 companies and I was fortunate enough to work with some amazing people inside and outside of the company. 

In October of 2001, it was announced that Oracle was buying RightNow for $1.8B. My career continued with Oracle and I advanced in to Director and later Senior Director role within a few years. I led a 45 man-year project, completing it on time and helped bring it to market. After that project, I was tapped to lead the next Oracle Service Cloud web initiative. The project involved many teams across the globe with more than 130 engineers. I traveled internationally and met some fantastic people, building out the next platform for Oracle Service Cloud.

I learned a lot at Oracle and I will be forever grateful to them for the opportunities they provided me. That said, by 2015, the itch to launch a startup had to be scratched, and so I launched my own company with the former CTO of RightNow Technologies, Mike Myer.

## Quiq
In July of 2015, Mike and I met over beers to discuss some startup ideas. Mike had the idea to bring messaging to enterprise call centers, augmenting their existing CRM investments. I felt this was a great idea and could see the huge potential in a rare green-field market opportunity. We continued to discuss over the summer and by September, we both quit our jobs. We kicked off Quiq (then Centricient) on October 1, 2015. 

Many of the enterprise architectures I had worked on were LAMP-style monolithic architectures. These architecture have a lot of shortcomings and I was tired of hitting the same limitations. I started the Quiq architecture using AWS in a true microservices architecture using Docker for service encapsulation. I also wanted a consistent, repeatable infrastructure (something that was sadly rare in 2015) and utilized Ansible and Terraform to script all infrastructure changes. 
 
We built the company on this foundation and so far, it’s holding up well. We just passed 100% uptime for the last calendar year, all while utilizing continuous deployment in a zero-downtime environment. I am not claiming that I am responsible for all the success. That would be absurd and overlook the wonderful work from my team, who are amazing stewards of the system. They are extremely capable and built something bigger than I ever could do myself. I love my team and I’m grateful to them for their hard work, creativity, and diligence. Truly the best team I’ve ever worked with. I see the success of Quiq and I’m humbled by the team that built it.

As the VP of Engineering, I had to turn my focus to other matters as Quiq grew. I now oversee the product from conception to delivery. This includes product management, software engineering, quality assurance, cloud operations/engineering, customer service, and customer success. This is a huge task and stretched me in new ways. I was only able to do it with the kick ass team supporting me. I can’t list everyone, but those who changed many of my existing paradigms include Matt West, Ryan Huddleston, Kyle McIntyre, Shannon Haish, and of course my mentor Mike Myer. I’m so very excited to see where Quiq goes. 

I am one of the luckiest people you will ever meet; I get to go to work, do what I love, and stretch myself in new ways. I am blessed.
I have had a lot of successes but that's mostly because I've been surrounded by 
great minds of great character, intelligence and integrity.
