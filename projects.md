I have contributed in various ways to different open source projects over the years. The projects
I led are listed below.


### X10d
Before wireless networks, there was X10, which is a standard that communicates with devices
over the electrical lines in a home. It was great for home automation. I liked tinkering with X10 and could not find
a library for .NET so I wrote my own.

This existed on [CodePlex](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=x10d) but has been archived. I'll move
it to Github eventually.

### Gallatin Proxy
I wanted to created a proxy "platform" that could be used by parents or smaller organizations
to limit and filter content on networks, and created [Gallatin Proxy](https://github.com/williamoneill/Gallatin).
This project was later taken and ported to be used in home-based routers. 

## Volunteering

### Billings Police Department
Billings city passed legislation that all local pawn shops must report
serial numbers of new items to the police department. The police then
needed to go around to each pawn shop and pick up electronic copies of
their records. This data was eventually input in to servers at City
Hall
