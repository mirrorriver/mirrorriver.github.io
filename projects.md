I have contributed in minor ways to various open source projects over the years. 


### X10d
Before wireless networks for IoT, there was X10, a standard that communicated with devices
over the electrical lines in a home. It was great for home automation.I liked tinkering with X10 and could not find
a library for .NET so I wrote my own.

This existed on [CodePlex](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=x10d) but has been archived. I'll move
it to Github soon.

### Gallatin Proxy

## Volunteering

### Boy Scouts of America
