# Software Projects
I have contributed in various ways to different open source projects over the years. Some samples 
of projects I led are below.

## Billings Police Department
The city of Billings passed legislation that required all local pawn shops to report
serial numbers of new items to the police department. The data would then 
be entered in to a common database to search for stolen items. The intent was good, 
but this put a huge burden on the police department. Every week, a police
officer would need to go to each pawn shop and pick up an electronic version
of their records. They would then take these electronic versions back to city
hall where they were eventually added to the database. By the time all of this
happened, the thief and the stolen items were long gone. This was also made
harder by the fact some pawn shops are crooked and wanted to mess with the system. 
If a stolen item is found in their stores, they lose the item without any
compensation. Sadly, some pawn shops don't care if the item is stolen if they
can make a profit and not get caught.

I created a system that would automatically upload the data from the pawn shops
to the city hall servers. This data was immediately uploaded in to the database
and searches could be done with one day of latency (some pawn shops were slow).
I worked with another volunteer who did most of the database work. His queries
incorporated hurstics to help identify stolen items even when the pawn shops
tried to hide them by intentionally mistyping serial numbers (1 vs l, 0 vs 0, etc.)

In the first year, this updated system put one crooked pawn shop out of business and resulted 
in a few hundred arrests. The thieves grew wise to this and started taking their
stolen items to other nearby cities. Some of these cities were across state
lines, which eventually caught the attention of the FBI. The system eventually  
expanded beyond Billings in to nearby
cities and states.

Later that year, I received recognition from the federal government for the system
I helped create. I also was nominated for Montana's Citizen of the Year. I never
made a dime off of this system, but it was one of the most rewarding projects
I ever created. 

## Gallatin Proxy
I wanted to created a proxy "platform" that could be used by parents or smaller organizations
to limit and filter content on networks, and created [Gallatin Proxy](https://github.com/williamoneill/Gallatin).
This project was later taken and ported to be used in consumer routers to be used in homes. 

## X10d
Before wireless networks, there was X10, which is a standard that communicates with devices
over the electrical lines in a home. It was great for home automation. I liked tinkering with X10 and could not find
a library for .NET so I wrote my own.

This existed on [CodePlex](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=x10d) but has been archived. I'll move
it to Github eventually.


# Volunteering
It's important to give back to the communities in which we live. I try to remain
active in at least one activity that benefit those who live in my community, including the animals.
