Thanks for stopping by. This is the web site for
William O'Neill. 

In my day job, I'm the co-founder and VP of Engineering for Quiq, a great startup in Bozeman, MT.
I love what I do and I'm blessed to be a part of this amazing company. Best. Job. Ever. I'll stop talking about
myself, but if you are curious to learn more, head over to the About page.
